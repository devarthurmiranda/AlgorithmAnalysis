## Bubble Sort

### Description
Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the array and compares each pair of adjacent elements. If the element before is greater than the element after, the elements are swapped. The algorithm repeats this process n times, where n is the size of the array. The algorithm stops when no more swaps are needed.

### Pros
It is a simple algorithm to implement, it is stable and it does not require extra memory. It is also efficient when a small number of elements are partially sorted.

### Cons
It is inefficient when the array is large and unsorted. It is also inefficient when the array is sorted in reverse order. High time complexity.
