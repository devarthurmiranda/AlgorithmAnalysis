## Merge Sort

### Description

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, so it divides the array into smaller arrays recursivelly, until the array is of size 1. Then it merges the arrays back together, comparing the elements of the arrays and placing them in order. The algorithm repeats this process until the array is sorted and merged back together.

### Pros

It is a stable algorithm, it is efficient when the array is large and unsorted, and it has a low time complexity.

### Cons

It is not an in-place algorithm, so it requires extra memory.
