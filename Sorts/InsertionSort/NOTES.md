## Insertion Sort

### Description
Insertion sort compares the current element with the element before it and sets the element before to the current element position if the element before is greater. When it is not greater, the current element is in the correct position and the algorithm moves on to the next element. The algorithm repeats this process until the array is sorted.

### Pros
Simple algorithm to implement, stable, efficient when small number of elements are partially sorted.

### Cons
Inefficient when array is large and unsorted, inefficient when array is sorted in reverse order, high time complexity.
