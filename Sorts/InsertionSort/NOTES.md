## Insertion Sort

### Description
Insertion sort compares the current element with the element before it and swaps them if the element before is bigger, then moves on to the next element of the iteration and repeats the process.


### Pros
Simple algorithm to implement, stable, efficient when small number of elements are partially sorted.

### Cons
Inefficient when array is large and unsorted, inefficient when array is sorted in reverse order, high time complexity.
