## Article: Comparing different sorting algorithms

### Description

In this article, we will compare different sorting algorithms. A table will be used to present the results. All the algorithms were implemented in Java.

### Table of results

| Algorithm   | Best case | Average case | Worst case | Space complexity | Stable | Comparisons | Swaps | Time (ms) |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | --------- |
| Bubble sort | O(n)      | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)     | O(1)             | Yes    | 0.000000    | 0.000000    | 0.000000  |
| Insertion sort | O(n)      | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)     | O(1)             | Yes    | 0.000000    | 0.000000    | 0.000000  |

### Important notes

* The table will be updated as new algorithms are added.

* Stable: When two or more elements have the same value, the algorithm does not change the order of the elements.

* Comparisons: Refers to the total of comparisons made by the algorithm to sort the array.

* Swaps: Refers to the total of swaps made by the algorithm to sort the array.

* Time: Refers to the total time taken by the algorithm to sort the array.

* All the algorithms were tested with the same array of ten thousand elements. The array was generated with random numbers. The tests were performed on a computer with the following specifications:
